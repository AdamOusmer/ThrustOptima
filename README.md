>By [Adam Ousmer](https://github.com/AdamOusmer) for [Space Concordia - Rocketry Division](https://spaceconcordia.ca/rocketry)

## _PROJECT IN DEVELOPMENT_


## Introduction

> The main purpose of this software is to calculate the propensity of a rocket engine using a CT SCAN. 
>
> The software will be able to:
> 
> - Calculate the propensity of every scan read from a DICOMDIR file.
> - Determine the edges of any objects that contain one external edge and an optional internal edge.
> - This software is using a custom .thst file for database and user's options and .optm files to save user's data.

> _Future updates_
> - 3D rendering of the CT scan.


## Installation

## Project Status
> _**PROJECT IN DEVELOPMENT**_


## Introduction

The main purpose of this software is to calculate the propensity of a rocket engine using a CT SCAN. 

The software will be able to: 

> - Calculate the propensity of every scan read from a DICOMDIR file.
>- Determine the edges of any objects that contain one external edge and an optional internal edge.
> - This software is using a custom .thst file for database and user's options and .optm files to save user's data.


_Future updates:_
> - 3D rendering of the CT scan.


## Installation

> _Available soon_

For now, please make sure that you have python 3.11 or higher installed on your computer. (in future updates we will provide a standalone version of the software)


## Usage

> _Available soon_

For now, the main.js file is the main file to run the software. (in future updates we will provide a standalone version of the software)
